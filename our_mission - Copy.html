    <h1><em>Our mission</em></h1>

<p>The goal of the "web developer spaceship" is to make traveling
 to space affordable to the less privileged. To afford the trip to
 space, the travelers must prove they are residents of the United States,
  qualify for financial aid, be a Simpson College student,
  or receive a scholarship that covers some or all of the rate. 
  This trip to space is meant for educational purposes that are 
only provided in correspondence with Simpson College.</p>
